  * RedisCommander upgraded to 0.7.1.

  * Significant refactoring to Inithook:

    - New default: bind to 127.0.0.1 interface.
    - New default: leave 'protected mode' enabled/true when run
      non-interactively.
    - Rewording of some dialogs.
    - Replace '--bind_ip' switch with '--bind' - select either 'localhost' or
      'all' interfaces to bind to (rather than stating IP).
    - Fix typo in firstboot.d/40redis - closes #1392.

  * Fix Redis password check Confconsole plugin failing - closes #1533.

  * Rename Redis pasword check Confconsole plugin to make it clear it relates
    to Redis (menu entry comes from filename).

  * Note: Please refer to turnkey-core's 16.1 changelog for changes common to all
    appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
